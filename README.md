# Ship-Generator-Prototype
A simple prototype the procedurally generates spaceship sprites.

You must have DirectPlay enabled to run the executable.
The executable does not require the .bb files to run.

This is a simple prototype for a larger project I hope to someday make.
Feel free to use any sprites generated for any uses, including paid commercial projects.
